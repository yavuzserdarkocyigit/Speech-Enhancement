# Speech Enhancement

This project focuses on enhancing speech audio files by reducing Gaussian noise using Python and MATLAB. Two methods are applied for noise reduction: spectral subtraction and the SpeechBrain model. The performance of these methods is evaluated based on Mean Square Errors (MSE) and speech-to-text accuracy using the wav2vec model.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To enhance noisy speech audio files and compare the effectiveness of different noise reduction methods.
- **Noise Addition**: Gaussian noise is added to a sample audio file at a specified decibel level.
- **Noise Reduction Methods**: 
  - Spectral Subtraction
  - SpeechBrain Model
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - Mean Square Error (MSE)
  - Speech-to-Text Accuracy using wav2vec model
